Notes on M cells:
There were 1471 Myeloid SPLN FCS files from August 27, 2015. 
There were 767 Myeloid SPLN FCS files from March 08, 2016. There were two files which had no barcodes. Remaining number of files from this batch is: 765.

In total there were 2236 files.
There were 373 Genotypes (WTs + KOs)

From the August dataset, there were 119 files, whose barcodes were not listed; hence, they were removed. So we were now left with 1352 FCS files from the August Dataset.

From the March dataset, there were 89 files, whose barcodes were not listed; hence, they were removed. So we were left with 676 FCS files from the March Dataset.

In total now we have 2028 FCS files for the analysis. There were no corrupted files.
